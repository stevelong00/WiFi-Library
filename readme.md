This project is a .NET class library allowing you to control Wifi (802.11) network adapters installed in your Windows machine programmatically.

The library uses the [Native Wifi API](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms705969.aspx), available since Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2 (in a limited fashion, and only after applying a hotfix provided in [KB article 918997](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918997)). Older versions of Windows are not supported.

This is a fork of the Managed WiFi API located at <https://managedwifi.codeplex.com/>
